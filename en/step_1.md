Your new recording will be shown. You can **Re-record** your sound if you are not happy with it. 

Drag the orange circles to crop your sound; the part of the sound with a blue background (between the orange circles) will be the part that is kept.

When you are happy with your recording, click the **Save** button. You will be taken straight back to the **Sounds** tab and you will be able to see the sound that you just added.
